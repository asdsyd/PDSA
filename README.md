# PDSA
***
## Quiz-2 and End-Term-Exam carries great weightage
***
### Less focus on oppe
### PDSA OPPE UPCOMING ON 27th AUGUST
### 📌Today’s(24th July) PDSA OPPE questions :

1. Linked list - Create a method delete(pos), where we can delete the value at particular position.

2. Count number of occurrence of value in List in logn times.

3. Shortest cable length - Kruskals algorithm.

4. Min Coins required to get a value

### OBSERVATIONS and TIPS:

☝🏻Q1 & Q3 are SIMILAR to PPA/GRPA, it seems.

☝🏻Week 2-5 is highly important.

☝🏻Week 2-5 ( we can get 75 marks).

☝🏻Binary search will definitely be there.

☝🏻Week 2-6 and dynamic programming, go thru all questions.

Whoever is going to give OPPE tomorrow:-
For a quick revision , please go through these topics

- [ ] Quick Sort
- [ ] Merge Sort
- [ ] Binary Search
- [ ] Linked List- Traversing, Create
- [ ] Enqueue, Dequeue, Push, Pop
- [ ] Week-5 Shortest Path and Spanning Tree(1 atleast)
- [ ] Week-4 Traversing algorithm BFS, DFS, Topological Sort
- [ ] After week-5 approach you have to understand (Greedy, Divide and Conquer, DP)
***
7, 9 atleast 1 question will come
2,3,4,5- Mug up the algorithms i mentioned
For 5- Understand the implementation
Week-7 Only Merge Sort 
week-6- Leave
***
Also for DP question if you are not able to solve the question using DP, try to do that question using Recursion. If you are good with recursion(or have somewhere in life followed Striver's Recursion playlist) you will be able to tackle that question
***
topological sort, data structures (stack,queue,array,linked list etc.) bfs, dfs, sorting algorithms, asymptotic complexity
